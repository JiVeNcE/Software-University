1. ECLIPSE ---- This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot    cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework.    Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use    languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.


2. NETbeans ----- The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code     which is a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your      computer for your testing environment. This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which is a     whole different ball game).

3. Kate -----   Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor. Not to be looked down upon as it does a lot   more than a regular text edit can do and that is what makes this an indispensable product.

4. Gedit ---- Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup. Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.

5.Aptana Studio 3 ---- If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR. Even the studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. Aptana Studio 3 is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
