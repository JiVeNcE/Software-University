A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.

 Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table. A column consists of all the entries in a single field, such as the telephone numbers of all the customers. Fields, in turn, are organized as records, which are complete sets of information (such as the set of information about a particular customer), each of which comprises a row. The process of normalization determines how data will be most effectively organized into tables.
